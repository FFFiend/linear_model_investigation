We resort to using a Logistic Regression model since we are interested in predicting the candidate a survey respondent voted for, given the former's age, gender, education and race. A logistic regression model is suitable as our response variables (1 for Biden and 0 for Trump) are clearly binary.

Using logistic regression for this scenario is a good choice for several reasons:

    Binary Outcome: As you mentioned, logistic regression is specifically designed for binary outcomes, which is suitable for predicting whether a survey respondent voted for Biden (1) or Trump (0). Logistic regression models the probability of the response variable falling into a particular category given the predictor variables.

    Interpretability: Logistic regression provides easily interpretable results. The coefficients associated with each predictor variable represent the change in the log-odds of the outcome for a one-unit change in the predictor variable. This allows for clear interpretation of the effects of each predictor on the likelihood of voting for a particular candidate.

    Assumption of Linearity in Log Odds: Logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between the log odds of the outcome and the predictor variables. While this assumption should be checked, it often holds reasonably well in practice for many real-world scenarios.

    Efficiency: Logistic regression tends to perform well even with relatively small sample sizes compared to more complex models. Given that you have a limited set of predictor variables (age, gender, education, and race), logistic regression can efficiently model the relationship between these variables and the voting outcome.

    Regularization Techniques: If necessary, logistic regression can be extended with regularization techniques such as L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge) regularization to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance, especially if there are many predictor variables or multicollinearity issues.

    Statistical Inference: Logistic regression provides inferential statistics such as p-values and confidence intervals for the estimated coefficients, allowing you to assess the significance of each predictor variable in predicting the outcome.

Overall, logistic regression is a robust and interpretable method for modeling binary outcomes like voting preferences, making it a suitable choice for your scenario.
